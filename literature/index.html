			When he first arrived at High School, Syed was most looking forward to joining the wrestling team, hoping to find a group of people who would share his passion for Strong Guyism. He began asking the other students about when sign-ups were held but was surprised to find nobody could help him out. At first, he thought that the students were just clueless, but as he continued to ask around, he began to notice something strange. No matter who he asked or how he brought it up, the conversation would always end as soon as the word wrestling crossed his lips. Even the warmest, most confident of his classmates would suddenly be checking their shoulders and insisting they had no idea what he was talking about, before rushing off down the hall. After just a week of his search, it seemed that every student he passed in the halls was watching him suspiciously. Larger groups would explode in a cacophony of whispers as they stared at him, their eyes filled with shock and terror. 
			At first, he thought it was all in his head, simply the result of an active imagination coupled with the stress of a new school. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t be long before the evidence became too much to ignore. One day, as he opened his locker to retrieve his daily lunchtime ration of chicken and rice, a note fell out and landed face down on the floor. As he bent to pick it up, he saw through the page that it was not written in pen or pencil, but rather was made up of clippings from all sorts of newspapers and magazines, pasted haphazardly to form loose words. With no idea what it would be, he nervously turned the note over to read the message.
			“IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE, GIVE UP
			YOU WILL NEVER WRESTLE HERE ”
			Although this threat was meant to dissuade him, it goes without saying that Syed’s resolve would not be shaken so easily. In fact, as the note confirmed his suspicions that something larger was going on, it served only as inspiration to continue down his chosen path. 
			With a newfound vigour, Syed decided it was time to go straight to the top, to the highest authority he could think of: head gym teacher and lawyer, the honourable Doctor, Sir McKendrick Magglethorpe VI, Viscount of Scarborough and ruler from the Hardwood Throne. Syed ran down the halls and into his office, nearly breaking the linoleum tiles under his feet. He slammed the note down on Professor Magglethorpe’s desk and stared him down. Startled, the doctor looked up from his desk and opened his mouth, speaking with his usual pitchy royal patter.
			“You know Syed, students really are not suppo-“  
			“What happened to the wrestling team?” Syed asked, too excited to get caught in a discussion about where he is or isn’t allowed to go without permission. Magglethorpe’s eyes shot open wide, betraying his otherwise calm demeanour.
			“Why, I haven’t the slightest idea what yo-“ 
			“What happened to the wrestling team?” Syed asked again, nearly shouting as his patience wore thin, “I came here with one goal: to become a Strong Guy just like Chris Evans or Jacob, from the Twilight series. All I want is to join the wrestling team, but people are acting like I’m Colby Covington just for saying the word. What. Is. Going. On.” 
			As he was talking, Syed had picked up an ornate glass paperweight from the professor’s desk and, as he reached his final words, crushed it in his hand as if it were no more than a packet of soda crackers. Glancing down at the note Syed had thrown on his desk, which was now covered with a shimmering layer of glass dust, Professor Magglethorpe realized that it had already gone too far, and feigning ignorance would be of no use. He abandoned the calm, aloof expression he had worked so hard to maintain, replacing it with a sombre grimace as he turned his eyes back up to Syed, who hadn’t looked away or even blinked since barging in through the old mahogany door. They held this gruesome eye contact for what seemed like days, the only sounds in the room the low crackle of Sir Magglethorpe’s fireplace and the distant echo of basketballs coming through from the gymnasium. When Magglethorpe finally spoke, he did so in a low, measured tone (at least as much of someone with such a weak, prancing voice as his could manage), and with such severity that even the great Tony Ferguson would shudder to his core with fear. 
			“No student has dared utter that word in these corridors for over 30 years, and now you come in off your trolley, blathering to practically every student in the school as if it were nothing more than your average tea-time gossip.” As Professor Magglethorpe spoke, Syed continued staring into his eyes, noticing that they did not match the anger of his voice, but were instead filled with a fear greater than any he had seen before. Unfazed by the doctor’s clear attempt to intimidate him, Syed stood unaffected as the ominous torrent continued:
			“You are meddling in matters you shan’t ever understand, let alone have any hope of influencing. This school’s history is rich, its secrets unending, and its dangers uncountable. I suggest you walk out of this office and never think about floor mats or leotards ever again.”
				Magglethorpe pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose, retrieved his peacock’s feather quill from the inkwell on his desk, and began scrawling illegibly on the papers in front of him. 
				“Now if you’ll excuse me,” he said, keeping his gaze pointedly downwards, “I have attendance rolls that must be completed before the bell. ‘Tis Tender Tuesday in the dining hall and everyone knows that only those who arrive in due haste have any chance of acquiring those golden strips of the Gods’ ambrosia.”
				Syed’s brain was still spinning with questions, but he knew pressing the professor further would be futile, especially with his resolve supported by the desire for chicken tenders, which were undeniably the best item ever served in the cafeteria. Syed stood at the desk for moment, casting his eyes about the expansive study, across the old tombs that filled the walls, before his eyes came to rest on the Nobel Peace Prize which adorned the mantel, along with his numerous other accolades and achievements. He turned his back to the professor and walked to the door but paused before turning the doorknob to leave, turning back to get final word in against the professor. 
				“You know, for a man with so many titles and awards, I wouldn’t have expected so much fear over a 9th grader who just wants to wrestle.” With that, Syed opened the door and stepped through to the gym, not waiting to hear the professor’s defence. 
				Unfortunately for Syed, he had not yet learned the intricacies of the hallways and, having come in through a different entrance, did not realize that Magglethorpe’s door to the gym was nearer to the rafters than the floor, and Magglethorpe was not the type to go for a standard stairway arrangement. 
				So, instead of stepping out onto hardwood floors, Syed stepped out into nothing. For a split second he felt himself falling, but before he had even understood that feeling he was caught in some sort of swing, diverting his course gradually away from the floor and, eventually, back up towards the wall on the other side. This of course could not happen before the swing bought him right into the middle of the senior basketball team’s passing drills, where he miraculously avoided any serious injury (though he nearly got his head taken off at least twice).
				As the swing reached its peak, Syed was pushed backwards out of the seat, falling into a funnel-shaped net, which dropped him perfectly into a tube slide. The slide wound down around the walls, gradually bringing him down to the floor, dumping him unceremoniously two stories below the door he had just stepped out of.
			Coming from the warm, dusty candlelight of the professor’s study, Syed was practically blinded by the harsh fluorescent light that filled the gymnasium. Coupled with the amusement-park-worthy exit and the continued drumming of the senior basketball team practicing their dribbling, Syed was in such a haze he could barely tell where he was. He started stumbling towards where he thought the door would be, but instead ended up walking directly into the janitor’s cart, nearly pulling it down with him as he tripped and fell to his hands on the shiny hardwood floors. He tried to stand up, but his feet failed him once again and he suddenly found himself face down, his cheek pressed against the cold floor and his head still spinning. As he lay there trying to regain his composure, he felt a hand on in his shoulder and heard a friendly voice begin to speak.
			“You doin’ alright there bud?”
			Though Syed knew the voice must be coming from whoever had their hand on his shoulder, it sounded like he was yelling from the end of a hallway through a corrugated metal tube. Blinking the spots out of his eyes, Syed mumbled out a quiet “I’m okay” and turned his head to try and see who was talking to him.
			“That was a pretty hard fall there, you been hittin’ the sauce with Magglethorpe?” the man let out a hearty chuckle and Syed realized it was the old janitor, Mr. Hannigan. With his vision almost back to normal he glanced around and saw the cleaning supplies scattered around him and realized what it was that caused his fall.
			“Sorry Mr. Hannigan, I don’t know what’s going on with me, I’ll help you clean this up”
			“Ahhhh don’t ya worry about it, nothing I can’t handle myself, sure beats cleaning the bathrooms!” with this, Mr. Hannigan let out another hearty laugh, which echoed through the gym, drawing some unimpressed looks from the  nearby basketball players. “Just be more careful next time ya come out that door, I do love waxin’ these floors!” 
			Syed had more or less recovered by now and managed to sit up, though it certainly took some effort. Relieved, though unsurprised, by Mr. Hannigan’s understanding, Syed still tried to explain himself as much as he could. 
			“Yeah I’ll do my best, thanks.” He glanced up at Mr. Hannigan, who was leaning calmly on his mop handle, still chuckling to himself about who-knows-what. “I probably would’ve handled it better if Magglethorpe weren’t so tough to talk to. I just don’t get why everyone’s so worked up, all I want to do is find a wrest-“ 
			Suddenly, before Syed knew what was happening, Mr. Hannigan had spun his mop around his shoulder, looped it underneath Syed’s arms, and hoisted him up from the ground. Mr. Hannigan’s friendly smile had disappeared, and his eyes narrowed, tearing into Syed’s like lasers.
			“You should know by now not to say that word in public,” whispered Mr. Hannigan harshly, still holding Syed aloft, his feet dangling just off the floor. “I know you’re confused, and I know Magglethorpe wouldn’t have given you anything but more mystery and drama. You deserve to know the truth, but I can’t tell you here. Meet me at the east entrance at sundown, and I’ll show you why Magglethorpe is so scared.” 
			With that, Mr. Hannigan lowered Syed to the ground, and with the same grace and ease as before, twirled the mop behind his back and returned it to a more natural mop-holding position. 
			“And by Joe!” he shouted, returning to his normal, aggressively friendly demeanour, “there’s no need to be so formal! Call me Joe!” And with that, Mr. Hannigan, Joe, went back to mopping, whistling a tune that nobody but Syed would recognize: The Big Show’s entry music.
			
			
			
			Syed left the gymnasium and wandered down the hallway. Still shaken up from everything that had happened in the past few minutes, he tried to sort out what was going on. Overwhelmed by the thoughts spinning through his mind, he could only hold onto fragments of ideas for a couple seconds before they were replaced by something else. Only a couple thoughts really stuck out. One was that Magglethorpe was clearly in over his head with something, though Syed couldn’t imagine what he could be so scared of. The other was that Hannigan was far too strong, even for a janitor, and the grace with which he twirled his mop was evidence of a great deal of practice. He clearly had a secret of his own. 
			Although he now had even more questions than he’d started with, Syed realized that there was no point in wasting more brain power trying to figure out what was going on until he got an explanation for Mr. Hannigan.  Still, he struggled to clear his mind and couldn’t stop checking his watch. In an effort to make the sun set faster, Syed went home to work out and eat chicken and rice. This strategy seemed to work, as hours felt like seconds, and in no time the sun had nearly found its way to the horizon. After finishing his 5th plate of chicken and rice, Syed headed back to the school, and made his way to the East entrance, stepping into the long shadow the school cast on the adjacent football field.
			The schoolyard was empty, and Syed took a seat on a bench just a few meters away from the entryway. Not seeing any sign of Mr. Hannigan, Syed pulled Twilight from his bag and started reading to pass the time. Syed quickly got lost in its pages, and nearly forgot he was waiting for someone. Finally, as the last light drained from the sky and he could no longer see the words in front of him, Syed realized he had been waiting for over an hour with no sign of the janitor. He started to panic, wondering if he had missed him while he was so lost in the magical world of Twilight. 
			Just as that thought came into his head, he saw a figure come around from the other side of the school, carrying what looked like an old oil lamp. As the figure drew near, it cast the beam of its lamp onto Syed, and then let out a relieved sigh.
			“Thank goodness!” he said, in an excited whisper. “I was worried you would have given up by now.” It was, of course, Mr. Hannigan though his usual janitor’s outfit was mostly covered by a rough woolen cloak he had wrapped around his body and over his head, hiding all but the bottom of his face from the warm light of the oil lamp. 
			“Sorry for the delay,” he said, keeping his voice much lower than usual. “I got distracted by a garage sale on my way over, lost track of time… I found this sweet antique lamp though, pretty cool right? Anyways, I got something else for ya.” Mr. Hannigan extended his arm and passed Syed a rough bundle of cloth. “It’s a cloak, we can’t let risk someone seeing us snooping around the school at night.”
			Syed undid the knots holding the bundle together and wrapped the rough burlap cloak around his shoulders and over his head, matching the style of Mr. Hannigan’s. 
			“Perfect! Now we’re ready. Follow me.”
			
			Mr. Hannigan walked over to the door and pulled out a keychain which must have had at least a hundred keys of all different sizes. Illuminating it with the lamp, he deftly tossed the ring in the air and caught it again by one of the keys, which he proceeded to insert into the lock, unlocking and opening the door. He turned to Syed, who had yet to say a single word, and raised a single finger to his lips to indicate that they needed to be quiet. Syed, thankful that the cloak would hide his eyes (which he could not stop rolling due at all the dramatic flair), followed Mr. Hannigan into the building, closing the door slowly behind them to avoid disturbing the silence.
			The pair walked swiftly but silently down the halls, the lamp light bobbing from side to side while their cloaks flapped behind them. Not yet having had the time to familiar himself with the school, Syed quickly lost track of where he was as Mr. Hannigan led him rapidly through the halls, not breaking his pace until he came to the door of a supply closet next to the gym. As he opened the door, Syed saw that it wasn’t a supply closet at all, but rather an old spiral stone staircase leading down into the basement.
			They stepped through the door, and as it closed behind them, Mr. Hannigan dropped his hood to his shoulder.
			“We’re safe now,” he said, leading Syed down the stone steps. “This used to be the main storage room for the school’s athletics department, but I’m the only one who’s been down here for years.”
			“So you can tell me what’s going on now?” asked Syed excitedly, as Mr. Hannigan set the lamp down on a table at the bottom of the steps to turn the lights on. The fluorescent tubes flickered on, illuminating a rather mundane storage area, relative to the ancient stairs that brought them into it. It was mostly filled with old derelict workout equipment, along with a few stacks of nondescript cardboard boxes. Against the far wall was a trophy case, its glass shattered, with one trophy sitting alone on the middle shelf.
			“In a minute,” responded Mr. Hannigan, “we still have further to go.”  
			With that, he strode across the room to the trophy case, grasped that one lonely trophy, and pushed it to the side. Syed watched in amazement as Mr. Hannigan, using the trophy as a handle, pushed the entire case to the side with as much ease as if it were a sliding glass door. Then, ducking through a small opening which the case had previously concealed, Mr. Hannigan disappeared into darkness.
			
			
			
				Syed approached the opening slowly, unsure of what was hiding in the darkness. Then, he heard the click of a light switch at the other end, and peering around the corner, he could suddenly see that it was just a short tunnel, at the end of which stood Mr. Hannigan. 
				“Come on then!” he said, beckoning Syed to join him in what appeared to be yet another hidden storage room, “Don’t go learning patience on me now! You’re finally about to learn the truth!”
				Mr. Hannigan’s ultimately words proved unnecessary, as Syed, seeing that there was more than just darkness in the wall, had already begun to make his way down the tunnel, into what would prove to be the sanctum of his thus-far scorned intentions. 
				As he caught up to Mr. Hannigan, he was shocked as he realized the scale of the chamber, and then, seeing its contents, stood completely immobilized by his amazement. It was like a cathedral, with vaulted stone ceilings that must have extended all the way up to the roof of the school. But this was clearly no temple of any ordinary faith; it was in fact a temple of strength. Hanging from the ceiling, where there should be tapestries, instead there were wrestling mats. On the floor beneath, where there should be pews, there were instead rows on rows of workout equipment. Some perplexingly advanced, others ancient and rudimentary, but all were as pristine as if they had just been built. And then, on the walls, where there should have been art, stood trophy case after trophy case, filled with the regalia of the Strong Guy: weights, trophies, championship belts, and all other manner of memorabilia. 
				“What is this place?” asked Syed, still unable to process that this Shangri La had been in his school all this time.
				“This is the temple where we used to hold our weekly Muscle Mass. A place for Guys to become Strong. It may be tough to believe, but this school was once a bastion for people like yourself.” Mr. Hannigan gestured to one of the trophy cases, which was stuffed with trophies of all shapes and sizes, some precariously balanced on top of the others as there wasn’t enough space on the shelves. “That case contains the spoils of just one year of wrestling tournaments. While I was a member, we won every tournament or exhibition we attended except one. Unfortunately, that one loss is the one which now overwhelms my memory…”
				Syed’s head was spinning with questions and, struggling to decide where to start, he focused on the most surprising part of Mr. Hannigan’s statement. Syed managed to stutter out a question, completely unable to disguise the shock in his voice.
				“While you were a member?! You mean, you wrestled here?” 
			Mr. Hannigan laughed at Syed’s uncontrollable disbelief and began to unhook a picture frame from the wall as he started to reply.
				“I know it’s tough to believe seeing me now,” he said, gesturing to his old, frail-looking frame, “but it’s true. I was a lot like you back then, so naturally I joined the wrestling team right away.” 
				With this, Mr. Hannigan passed the picture to Syed, who saw that it was an old championship photo of a wrestling team, the school’s logo displayed clearly on their uniforms. Standing proud in the middle, Syed saw Mr. Hannigan. Though his muscles had been much larger and his hair much thicker, his face was almost completely unchanged, with the notable exception of his bare upper lip, which today was adorned with a strong, broad moustache. Standing just in front of Mr. Hannigan, shorter but just as proud, Syed was shocked to see yet another familiar face.
				“Is that… Magglethorpe?” Magglethorpe had seen similar changes in time but was quickly given away as he was the only wrestler wearing a robe over his leotard, not unlike the one he was wearing when Syed had visited him that morning. 
				“Indeed it is,” replied Mr. Hannigan, “he and I were co-captains that year, though it was rare for us to agree on anything. He had clearly lost sight of our true goals, and it was him who ultimately led to our demise.”
				Mr. Hannigan was no longer his usually cheery self, but neither was he speaking with the same grim mystery as he had in the gym. Instead, he spoke with a quiet sorrow, his words soaked in longing. 
				“What happened then?” asked Syed. Looking up at the wall, Syed noticed that the picture he was looking at was the last in a long line of annual team photos. “Was this the last wrestling team we had?”
				After a long silence, Mr. Hannigan casting his tearful eyes across the trophies and belts, he finally began to spoke.
				“Yes,” he said, “that picture was the last wrestling team WCCI ever had.” Mr. Hannigan’s voice wavered, and he paused for a moment to gather himself before continuing.
			
			
			
				“As I said before, Magglethorpe and I were co-captains that year, and we had one of the finest teams this school had ever seen. Tournament after tournament, our wrestlers proved to be the Strongest Guys out there, winning every match in mere seconds. 
				“The school was, at this point, used to having an amazing wrestling team, but our success was unprecedented. As the year went on, every member of the team became somewhat of a celebrity, at least within the walls of the school. Our cafeteria table was set with a feast every day; lowerclassmen would wait at our lockers for hours for a chance at an autograph; there were even full-service spas set up in the back of most classrooms for our exclusive use.
			“If the rest of our teammates were seen as celebrities, Magglethorpe and I were practically gods. The NARPs would bring us offerings of the finest foods in the cafeteria, never making us stand in line for even a minute. As we walked down the halls, many would even drop to their knees as we walked past, as if in worship. It was all very uncomfortable to me, knowing how these people – our peers – saw us, but what made me even more uncomfortable was watching Magglethorpe bask in it. While I accepted the gifts but did what I could to dissuade them, he encouraged it, sending people out to perform whatever petty errands he had to run that day. It wasn’t long until he had a sort of entourage following him wherever he went, and I think he even started to believe that he was in fact some sort of deity. 
			“It was then that he started wearing those ridiculous robes, as if he were the pope or some kind of sad wizard. Somehow, the rest of the school couldn’t see through his charade the same as I did, and as he got more and more ridiculous, somehow more power followed close behind. His rabid followers were the ones who built this temple, at his command, to his precise specifications. He told them it would be a monument to The Strength, but his plans and its original state were more a shrine to Magglethorpe’s arrogance than to any sort of greater good.
			“The new level of success we had realized had other impacts as well, the most noticeable of which was the unprecedented number of people we had who wished to join the team and share in our newfound glory. Though it broke my heart, our team was already as large as we could support, and we had to turn hundreds and hundreds of potential Strong Guys away. Most of the refusals were uneventful, a couple quick words in a hallway, maybe some tears, and they were on their way.
			“One day however, I was alone in the gym, cleaning up after a team practice, when GIRL MCGIRL came in and started walking across the hardwood floors. At first, I didn’t pay her much mind, assuming she was just passing through, or maybe getting something out of the equipment room. By the time I realized that she was walking straight towards me, she had already come within 3 meters and was asking whether she could join the team.
			“I was caught off guard; it was a different time then, and at that point the wrestling team had never seen interest from any girls, but I realized that there were no rules against it and it seemed like a co-ed team could be a good idea, especially considering the passion GIRL MCGIRL clearly had. Despite all this, I couldn’t get around the excessive numbers we already had, and the number of guys we had already turned away. Just as I was about to explain, to let her down easy and encourage her to try another year, the silence of the gymnasium was broken by the doors to the main hall crashing open. 
			“I looked over to see Magglethorpe take three quick steps into the gym and pause, moving forward just far enough that his sea of urchinlike followers could pour in around him, quickly filling the entire room. Then, with an awful scowl on his face, he fixed his eyes on me and strode across the gym, his intricate robes flowing in the wind behind him.
			“‘WHAT BLASPHEMY IS BEING SPOKE UNTO THIS SACRED HALL?’ he yelled, gesturing towards the rusty rafters and broken bleachers that adorned the gym as a path opened up in the crowd,  ‘A NON-MALE, DEMANDING ENTRY INTO MY WRESTLING TEAM??? THIS MUST NOT STAND!’
			“I tried to calm him down, tried to tell him that she had come with the same passion as we both had, tried to tell him that if our team wasn’t already full she would have been a great addition, but his delusion of self-importance had become too strong and he cut me off before I could even get a single word out.
			“’SILENCE!’ he yelled, ‘Have you not already done enough damage here, you scoundrel and rapscallion?’ Then, turning his attention to his horde, who were jeering and hollering archaic insults at me with all their might, he began his tirade. ‘These two you see before you are conspiring to undermine the valor of the sacred order which so many of you revere and hope to join someday. It is about the Strong Guy, not the Strong Girl!’ he exclaimed, hate and saliva spraying into the crowd below him. ‘We must protect our heritage and punish these FOOLS who seek to overturn it! Arrest her!’
			“Despite his voice cracking on the word arrest, the mob ate it up, cheering even louder than before and beginning to close tight around GIRL and I. Suddenly, a group of children dressed in rags and dirt filtered out of the crowd and surrounded GIRL, lifting her off her feet and carrying her out the door while chanting ‘LONG LIVE THE GOD OF STRENGTH’
			“Then, just as fast as they came in, the mob dispersed, draining through the surrounding halls, leaving me awestruck and confused by what had happened. Fortunately, Magglethorpe’s imagined power did not give him the authority to actually arrest people, so GIRL MCGIRL was released as soon as the children were too tired to carry her further, but as word of the conflict spread, the tone of the entire school changed. Most importantly, GIRL MCGIRL seemed to have abandoned her desire to wrestle and, inspired though some had been, no other girls dared follow in her footsteps.
			“From that point on, Magglethorpe continued to grow his following more and more, practically taking over control of the school. While he was busy ruling the school, I continued working with the team, building our strength and growing our muscles so we could maintain our flawless record through the season. Despite Magglethorpe’s lost focus, he was still a fantastic wrestler, and between us two and the team I had built, we were unstoppable. Our success placated me, making me more and more ambivalent to Magglethorpe’s growing power. I wish I had been more proactive about cutting him down, for when the good times finally ended, they fell like… like something that falls really fast. 
			“We had a couple amazing months, until one day we received a challenge. I arrived in the gym at 5am for my routine morning workout and discovered a fine manila envelope, sealed with wax and addressed in beautiful calligraphy to Magglethorpe and I, sitting just inside the door. I opened it to find what appeared to be a challenge to a wrestling showdown, signed at the end by ‘GIRL MCGIRL and the Non-Males.’ It turns out that Magglethorpe’s explosion had not been the deterrent we believed it to be but had simply incentivised more discretion on their part. GIRL MCGIRL immediately started a clandestine girls’ wrestling team, which had been training in secret for months, and were now challenging us to an exhibition tournament to show that they deserve their place. 
			“While I myself was happy to hear that they didn’t capitulate under Magglethorpe’s restrictions, he was not so pleased to hear the news. He started raving about how disrespectful it was for them to disobey him, and immediately called the rest of our team in for a meeting, still fuming with rage. He carried that rage into the meeting, and despite my best efforts, he managed to convince the team that this was some affront to our standing, that we should respond with rage and fervor. So, as I lobbied alone for peace, my team agreed to war. The challenge would be accepted, the matches set throughout the following week, and the stakes? The losing team faced dissolution, ridicule, and expulsion. It was to be a death match.”
			“When the matches began, our team was expecting a cakewalk, not realizing the impact Magglethorpe’s oppression had had on the wills of the so-called non-male team. After the first two days of matches, although we had a lead, it was nowhere near the blowout my companions had expected. As they saw the passion with which these girls trained and fought, my teammates’ commitment to Magglethorpe’s zealous rage began to waver. Some of the most reasonable of them came to me that night, embarrassed they had let Magglethorpe sway them so. At the end of the fourth day, with only one more day of matches remaining, the tournament was at nearly a dead tie. By that point, every one of my teammates (excluding, of course, Magglethorpe) had fully recovered from the rage. They were instead impressed by the dedication and power demonstrated by the Non-Males and, after a short discussion, we agreed that if we won, we would nullify our original agreement, allowing the Non-Males to continue.
			“Just at that moment, a bin of basketballs in the corner erupted, and Magglethorpe leapt out from his hiding place at the bottom.
			‘Ahhh!’ he yelled, struggling to overcome the cacophony of basketballs bouncing randomly around the changeroom, ‘So this is how my nobility behaves when they believe their words are unheard by ears higher than their own! You should all be ashamed, you weak-willed pansies! Nullify? NULLIFY? Hah.’
			“Magglethorpe laughed condescendingly as he reached into his robe and pulled out a thick roll of parchment.
			“‘I knew this moment would come, which is why I developed this contract between myself and GIRL MCGIRL, that whoever’s team does win shall be declared Ruler of the Hardwood Throne, from which he or she will have ultimate power over this entire realm!”
			“We were shocked; the contract laid out far more powers to the winner than we could have even imagined, essentially giving them absolute and infinite power over every single piece of school life. Magglethorpe’s power in the school had grown to such an excess that we knew we had no means to stop him, and we were forced to go along with his plan.
			“The next day, the tournament’s deadlock grew stronger. For each match we managed to win, the non-males would find a new spring of inspiration and would invariably win the following match by the exact same margin. To most of our team, this deadlock was the only shred of hope we had left, for a tie would be the only way to avoid what would otherwise be a tragic end due to Magglethorpe’s contract.
			“When the penultimate match was concluded, the tournament remained tied, with only one match remaining, though it seemed set to be the most exciting match of the week: Magglethorpe vs. GIRL MCGIRL.
			“Initially, the match was as exciting as anticipating, the two of them putting on a clinic in high-level wrestling. Each time we though one had the upper hand, the other would mount a perfect response. Piledrivers, powerbombs, brainbusters, suplex, all executed to perfection at a speed that was almost incomprehensible to those watching. At one point a folding chair appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, which within seconds had found itself wrapped around GIRL’s head, where it quickly disintegrated as she broke free from it.
			“Suddenly, we saw Magglethorpe setting up for a single leg seatbelt toss, just centimeters away from the circle which dictated the fighting area. For a split second, my team erupted in shouts, in complete disbelief that Magglethorpe would do something so risky. But before he had any chance of hearing us, he had executed the move, his momentum carrying him to rest, half his body out of bounds. He had lost.
			“The official result was announced, and pandemonium ensued. The crowed screamed at the top of their lungs: some voices twinkling with joy, others burning with fiery rage. My team, frozen in place by the shock, unable to even speak a single word between us, were all seized and dragged from the gymnasium out into the main field. The crowd flowed out of the stands to follow, crowding around as we were forced to our knees, as if we were about to be executed. Suddenly, GIRL MCGIRL appeared floating effortlessly over the crowd, before finding her place at the top of the nearby bleachers, clutching that wretched contract in her hands. 
			“Standing tall above the crowd, she triumphantly cast the bottom of the parchment roll down the bleachers. The crowd parted as it bounced down the metal steps, allowing it to continue until it had unfurled nearly to the middle of the field, with more to go had momentum carried it farther. As she held it up to read, the crowd fell completely silent, so that even we, kneeling so far out in the grass, could hear her breathing. She began to read in a commanding voice the various articles and clauses that had been agreed upon. This dragged on for what seemed like hours, but still she maintained complete control of the crowd, not once having to fight a distraction or re-command their respect. As she neared the end of the document, I noticed something odd: Magglethorpe had disappeared. While every other member of our team was neatly lined up to hear our sentence, he was nowhere to be seen. 
			“Just as I had this realization, MCGIRL reached the clauses of our condemnation. By this point the crowd had fully taken her side, cheering as each line punished us more and more, ultimately ending in our expulsion.
			“Then, the crowd became a victory parade, and we were abandoned in the field to ponder the many questions there were to ponder. How had Magglethorpe made such a rookie mistake? Why hadn’t he been dragged along side us to our public shaming and expulsion? Above all else though, we were just trying to understand what had happened; what all this would mean for us.
			“Most of the members tried to forget about it, tried to move on with their lives, but I couldn’t stand to see Magglethorpe win, as it was clear to me that he had somehow masterminded this to his own benefit. So I stuck around, growing this moustache so I could secretly apply to be a janitor, a position which would allow me to investigate Magglethorpe without anyone taking notice of my snooping. 
			“When I first got the job, I immediately got to work sealing off and restoring this temple, doing my best to lay low until I felt I had become enough a part of the background of the school to blend into the walls. Though I was ready for my patience to be put to the test in a long, drawn out investigation, it only took a year before Girl McGirl graduated and I found out what had happened. As it turns out, the original contract allowed the Ruler of the Hardwood Throne to transfer the title, and the associated powers, to whomever they wished upon their departure from the school. 
			“So, as you might have guessed by now, she transferred it all to Magglethorpe, who went on to use and abuse every statute he could, making himself a quasi-monarch within these walls and banning ALL wrestling in the school for the rest of time. I still couldn’t understand how he pulled all this off, considering that he never seemed like he could have cooperated with Girl McGirl, let alone in in such a self-sacrificial fashion, but in the end, I realized none of it mattered. The fact of the matter was that Magglethorpe had given himself absolute power, and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy to remove him from the so-called Hardwood Throne he had made for himself.
			“Still, I knew I couldn’t just give up, so I dedicated my life to finding a way to take him down. For years it felt hopeless; nothing had changed, there was still not even the tiniest sliver of a path that would lead to his downfall. Then, one day, I was cleaning out a supply closet next to the main gym, when I found these.”
			With this, Mr. Hannigan gestured up to the four large wrestling mats that hung from the ceiling like tapestries. Syed was confused.
			“The floor mats?” he asked, “How could they possibly change anything?”
			For the first time since launching into his story, Mr. Hannigan smiled. 
			“These aren’t just any floormats!” he said, each word he spoke carrying more energy and excitement than the last, “These are the most important floormats in the history of this school; it is these fine pieces of foam and leather which protected our bones from the hardwood during that fateful tournament; it was on these very floormats that the last wrestling match this school ever saw was fought.”
			“Okay, but they’re still just mats,” said Syed, still confused by Mr. Hannigan’s visible excitement. “What’s the big deal?”
			At this point, Mr. Hannigan was practically shaking, his eyes wild as he looked up at the ceiling.
			“Just mats?” he stopped to laugh for a solid minute and a half before continuing, “Take a closer look my boy, look at the wear patterns, the sweat stains! Do you not see how much more there is to these?”
			Suddenly, Syed saw it. The tears and dents and stains weren’t in the random patterns one would expect. No, on these mats the patterns made images, a story even. Each of the four was different, though it was clear they were related.
			Mr. Hannigan could see when the realization hit Syed and took this as his cue to explain what they were looking at.
			“You see, each of these gorgeous tapestries tells a story: the first shows the golden days, those days before Magglethorpe’s tyranny began; the second shows their end, that fateful match and Magglethorpe’s play for power; the third shows today, a world without wrestling, a world without strength… these are the darkest days…” He trailed off for a moment as sadness once more filled his eyes, but it was quickly replaced with a wide grin as he looked back at the fourth tapestry.
			“And the fourth,” his grin grew ever wider as he looked back to Syed, his eyes now filled with hope. “The fourth prophesizes the triumph of The Strongest Strong Guy, the fall of Magglethorpe, and the restoration of Strength to these sacred halls. It is said that only the Strongest Strong Guy will be able to overcome the powers laid out in that fell contract. That’s why I’m so excited to see you here.”
			For what must have been the twentieth time that day, and possibly the hundredth time that week, Syed was utterly lost at what was going on. Noticing this, Mr. Hannigan chuckled to himself some more, before turning and walking towards a small door at the side of the temple.
			“Follow me,” he said, without turning around to look, “there’s more I need to show you.”
			Syed followed him through yet another mysterious door, into a small, dimly lit chamber. Looking around, Syed realized that this must be where the real treasures were held. The walls were plastered with relics: in a beautiful frame near the door were Yoel Romero’s Shorts (those used against Derek Brunson); on a shelf further down the wall he saw Daniel Cormier’s Carl’s Jr Membership Card; next to it, Buvaisar Satiev's Ushanka; on the back wall, shining in the candlelight, was Henry Cejudo’s Olympic Gold Medal.
			While Syed stood near the entrance, taking in this cornucopia of Strong Guy relics, Mr. Hannigan continued to the back of the hall, stopping next to a large picture frame, which appeared to hold some sort of funhouse mirror. He finally looked back at Syed, waiting patiently until he had absorbed the treasure room before continuing.
			“This here is the Mirror of Htgnerts” he said, resting his hand on the fine mahogany frame, “It allows anyone to see themselves at the strongest they could ever hope to be.” He stepped in front of it, looking in to see his reflection. “For me, the old man that I am, there isn’t much of a change.” Syed looked and saw indeed that, though his chest appeared a bit broader, and his legs a bit thicker, it was more or less the Mr. Hannigan he knew.
			“Why don’t you give it a try?”
				With this, Mr. Hannigan stepped aside, gesturing for Syed to take his place in front of the mirror. Hesitantly, Syed walked forward into the frame of the mirror. Excited as he was to see his potential, he also feared that it would disappoint him.
				However, as he walked, something strange happened. At first, there was a blurriness that started at the bottom of the frame, just as his head should have come into view. As he walked closer and closer, the blurriness grew, and behind it came a darkness which eventually obscured the entire mirror.
				“I don’t think it’s working.” Syed said, staring into the void that should have been his body, “It’s just gone black.”
				With this, Mr. Hannigan became practically giddy with excitement, much to Syed’s confusion.
				“What are you so happy about?” He asked, now angry that he couldn’t see his potential.
				“It’s you!” said Mr. Hannigan, practically shouting with excitement, “You are the Strongest Strong Guy! This mirror shows us the limit of our potential strength, but for you, there is no limit! With the right training, with the right dedication, you will be able to achieve a level of strength never before seen on this our planet Earth!”
				Once again, Syed stood dumbfounded, unable to comprehend what was going on.
				“So, what do I do?” he asked, still blown away by everything that had just happened to him. Mr. Hannigan wasted no time in replying. 
				“You train. You cultivate mass. Then one day, when all is ready, you shall take down Magglethorpe and restore order to this wrestle-less domain!”
			
			So, with Mr. Hannigan’s secret support, Syed founded Wrestlers Against Non-Males. Named in honour of that team which Magglethorpe had betrayed so many decades before, it was a club for ANY like-minded students who wished to improve their strength and study the ways of the Strong Guy. Unfortunately, due to the fear Magglethorpe had fostered, none were brave enough to take his side, and Syed remained the only member of the club for all his years at the school. However, this never discouraged him, and he continued training every day to improve his strength, in hopes that one day he could free the school from Magglethorpe’s tyranny.
