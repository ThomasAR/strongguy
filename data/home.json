    "bio": "Syed @nickname@ Hussain carries the knowledge of Tai Lopez, a jump shot worthy of the WNBA, and the inspirational aura of Russ. Born with no more than half a bicep, Syed @nickname@ Hussain was inspired by his favourite series of young adult novels: Twilight. Reading about the amazing feats performed by Jacob’s toned, buff body, Syed @nickname@ Hussain dedicated his life to building his body to be as strong as that of his lupine idol. Starting when he was no more at Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute in Mississauga, Ontario, Syed @nickname@ Hussain developed “Wrestlers Against Non-Males”, where he was voted ______. His dedication, as demonstrated by his consistent subscription to the local GoodLife Fitness, was unparalleled, and by the time he was 18 he had already become massive enough to sustain a measurable gravitational pull. Unfortunately, the good times could not last forever. In 2017, during his first year of university, Syed @nickname@ Hussain, made friends with one of the most dangerous groups at his school: the cross-country runners. Bonding over their shared love of HIIT, the distance runners drew him in with promises of 0% body fat and endless endorphin highs. These were truly his darkest days. Though no definitive evidence has come to light, many historians allege that he experimented with cardio during this time, which would explain the rapid loss of muscle mass exhibited in this period.",
